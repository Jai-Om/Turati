The mail function does not work from the local server because:
1) The OS does not allow the port to be changed from the local server.
2) Can use Composer and PHPMailer to add a mail server port to the local server.
3) Tried doing that.
4) The Windows firewall and the antivirus firewall went crazy when I tried to set that up.
5) There were several warning regarding Backdoor access to my email account, and I decided to not try it out with my actual email address.
